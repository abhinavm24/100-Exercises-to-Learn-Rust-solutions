// TODO: whenever `title` and `description` are returned via their accessor methods, they
//   should be normalizedâ€”i.e. leading and trailing whitespace should be removed.
//   There is a method in Rust's standard library that can help with this, but you won't
//   find it in the documentation for `String`.
//   Can you figure out where it is defined and how to use it?
